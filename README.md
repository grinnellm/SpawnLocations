# Find Pacific Herring spawn index sites

Find Pacific Herring spawn index sites around a point.
By default, spawns are summarised by year and Location in tonnes (t).
Alternatively, users can choose to summarise spawns by Location only (i.e., aggregate spawns over years).
Users can view spawns as a figure and as a table, both of which can be downloaded.

Grinnell et al.
([In prep.](https://github.com/grinnellm/HerringSpawnDocumentation/blob/master/SpawnIndexTechnicalReport.pdf))
has details on how we calculate the Pacific Herring spawn index.
Note that the 'spawn index' represents the raw survey data only,
and is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter *q*;	
therefore it is a relative index of spawning biomass
