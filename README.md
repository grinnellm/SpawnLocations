For more information or to report issues, contact Matthew Grinnell or Jaclyn Cleary, DFO Science, Pacific Biological Station.
Note that the 'spawn index' represents the raw survey data only, and is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter **q**; therefore it is a relative index of spawning biomass.
